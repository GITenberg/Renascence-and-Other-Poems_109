Renascence<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
All I could see from where I stood<BR>
Was three long mountains and a wood;<BR>
I turned and looked another way,<BR>
And saw three islands in a bay.<BR>
So with my eyes I traced the line<BR>
Of the horizon, thin and fine,<BR>
Straight around till I was come<BR>
Back to where I'd started from;<BR>
And all I saw from where I stood<BR>
Was three long mountains and a wood.<BR>
Over these things I could not see;<BR>
These were the things that bounded me;<BR>
And I could touch them with my hand,<BR>
Almost, I thought, from where I stand.<BR>
And all at once things seemed so small<BR>
My breath came short, and scarce at all.<BR>
But, sure, the sky is big, I said;<BR>
Miles and miles above my head;<BR>
So here upon my back I'll lie<BR>
And look my fill into the sky.<BR>
And so I looked, and, after all,<BR>
The sky was not so very tall.<BR>
The sky, I said, must somewhere stop,<BR>
And&mdash;sure enough!&mdash;I see the top!<BR>
The sky, I thought, is not so grand;<BR>
I 'most could touch it with my hand!<BR>
And reaching up my hand to try,<BR>
I screamed to feel it touch the sky.<BR>
I screamed, and&mdash;lo!&mdash;Infinity<BR>
Came down and settled over me;<BR>
Forced back my scream into my chest,<BR>
Bent back my arm upon my breast,<BR>
And, pressing of the Undefined<BR>
The definition on my mind,<BR>
Held up before my eyes a glass<BR>
Through which my shrinking sight did pass<BR>
Until it seemed I must behold<BR>
Immensity made manifold;<BR>
Whispered to me a word whose sound<BR>
Deafened the air for worlds around,<BR>
And brought unmuffled to my ears<BR>
The gossiping of friendly spheres,<BR>
The creaking of the tented sky,<BR>
The ticking of Eternity.<BR>
I saw and heard, and knew at last<BR>
The How and Why of all things, past,<BR>
And present, and forevermore.<BR>
The Universe, cleft to the core,<BR>
Lay open to my probing sense<BR>
That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence<BR>
But could not,&mdash;nay! But needs must suck<BR>
At the great wound, and could not pluck<BR>
My lips away till I had drawn<BR>
All venom out.&mdash;Ah, fearful pawn!<BR>
For my omniscience paid I toll<BR>
In infinite remorse of soul.<BR>
All sin was of my sinning, all<BR>
Atoning mine, and mine the gall<BR>
Of all regret. Mine was the weight<BR>
Of every brooded wrong, the hate<BR>
That stood behind each envious thrust,<BR>
Mine every greed, mine every lust.<BR>
And all the while for every grief,<BR>
Each suffering, I craved relief<BR>
With individual desire,&mdash;<BR>
Craved all in vain!  And felt fierce fire<BR>
About a thousand people crawl;<BR>
Perished with each,&mdash;then mourned for all!<BR>
A man was starving in Capri;<BR>
He moved his eyes and looked at me;<BR>
I felt his gaze, I heard his moan,<BR>
And knew his hunger as my own.<BR>
I saw at sea a great fog bank<BR>
Between two ships that struck and sank;<BR>
A thousand screams the heavens smote;<BR>
And every scream tore through my throat.<BR>
No hurt I did not feel, no death<BR>
That was not mine; mine each last breath<BR>
That, crying, met an answering cry<BR>
From the compassion that was I.<BR>
All suffering mine, and mine its rod;<BR>
Mine, pity like the pity of God.<BR>
Ah, awful weight!  Infinity<BR>
Pressed down upon the finite Me!<BR>
My anguished spirit, like a bird,<BR>
Beating against my lips I heard;<BR>
Yet lay the weight so close about<BR>
There was no room for it without.<BR>
And so beneath the weight lay I<BR>
And suffered death, but could not die.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Long had I lain thus, craving death,<BR>
When quietly the earth beneath<BR>
Gave way, and inch by inch, so great<BR>
At last had grown the crushing weight,<BR>
Into the earth I sank till I<BR>
Full six feet under ground did lie,<BR>
And sank no more,&mdash;there is no weight<BR>
Can follow here, however great.<BR>
From off my breast I felt it roll,<BR>
And as it went my tortured soul<BR>
Burst forth and fled in such a gust<BR>
That all about me swirled the dust.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Deep in the earth I rested now;<BR>
Cool is its hand upon the brow<BR>
And soft its breast beneath the head<BR>
Of one who is so gladly dead.<BR>
And all at once, and over all<BR>
The pitying rain began to fall;<BR>
I lay and heard each pattering hoof<BR>
Upon my lowly, thatched roof,<BR>
And seemed to love the sound far more<BR>
Than ever I had done before.<BR>
For rain it hath a friendly sound<BR>
To one who's six feet underground;<BR>
And scarce the friendly voice or face:<BR>
A grave is such a quiet place.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The rain, I said, is kind to come<BR>
And speak to me in my new home.<BR>
I would I were alive again<BR>
To kiss the fingers of the rain,<BR>
To drink into my eyes the shine<BR>
Of every slanting silver line,<BR>
To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze<BR>
From drenched and dripping apple-trees.<BR>
For soon the shower will be done,<BR>
And then the broad face of the sun<BR>
Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth<BR>
Until the world with answering mirth<BR>
Shakes joyously, and each round drop<BR>
Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top.<BR>
How can I bear it; buried here,<BR>
While overhead the sky grows clear<BR>
And blue again after the storm?<BR>
O, multi-colored, multiform,<BR>
Beloved beauty over me,<BR>
That I shall never, never see<BR>
Again!  Spring-silver, autumn-gold,<BR>
That I shall never more behold!<BR>
Sleeping your myriad magics through,<BR>
Close-sepulchred away from you!<BR>
O God, I cried, give me new birth,<BR>
And put me back upon the earth!<BR>
Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd<BR>
And let the heavy rain, down-poured<BR>
In one big torrent, set me free,<BR>
Washing my grave away from me!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I ceased; and through the breathless hush<BR>
That answered me, the far-off rush<BR>
Of herald wings came whispering<BR>
Like music down the vibrant string<BR>
Of my ascending prayer, and&mdash;crash!<BR>
Before the wild wind's whistling lash<BR>
The startled storm-clouds reared on high<BR>
And plunged in terror down the sky,<BR>
And the big rain in one black wave<BR>
Fell from the sky and struck my grave.<BR>
I know not how such things can be;<BR>
I only know there came to me<BR>
A fragrance such as never clings<BR>
To aught save happy living things;<BR>
A sound as of some joyous elf<BR>
Singing sweet songs to please himself,<BR>
And, through and over everything,<BR>
A sense of glad awakening.<BR>
The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear,<BR>
Whispering to me I could hear;<BR>
I felt the rain's cool finger-tips<BR>
Brushed tenderly across my lips,<BR>
Laid gently on my sealed sight,<BR>
And all at once the heavy night<BR>
Fell from my eyes and I could see,&mdash;<BR>
A drenched and dripping apple-tree,<BR>
A last long line of silver rain,<BR>
A sky grown clear and blue again.<BR>
And as I looked a quickening gust<BR>
Of wind blew up to me and thrust<BR>
Into my face a miracle<BR>
Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,&mdash;<BR>
I know not how such things can be!&mdash;<BR>
I breathed my soul back into me.<BR>
Ah!  Up then from the ground sprang I<BR>
And hailed the earth with such a cry<BR>
As is not heard save from a man<BR>
Who has been dead, and lives again.<BR>
About the trees my arms I wound;<BR>
Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;<BR>
I raised my quivering arms on high;<BR>
I laughed and laughed into the sky,<BR>
Till at my throat a strangling sob<BR>
Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb<BR>
Sent instant tears into my eyes;<BR>
O God, I cried, no dark disguise<BR>
Can e'er hereafter hide from me<BR>
Thy radiant identity!<BR>
Thou canst not move across the grass<BR>
But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,<BR>
Nor speak, however silently,<BR>
But my hushed voice will answer Thee.<BR>
I know the path that tells Thy way<BR>
Through the cool eve of every day;<BR>
God, I can push the grass apart<BR>
And lay my finger on Thy heart!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The world stands out on either side<BR>
No wider than the heart is wide;<BR>
Above the world is stretched the sky,&mdash;<BR>
No higher than the soul is high.<BR>
The heart can push the sea and land<BR>
Farther away on either hand;<BR>
The soul can split the sky in two,<BR>
And let the face of God shine through.<BR>
But East and West will pinch the heart<BR>
That can not keep them pushed apart;<BR>
And he whose soul is flat&mdash;the sky<BR>
Will cave in on him by and by.<BR>

Interim
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
The room is full of you!&mdash;As I came in<BR>
And closed the door behind me, all at once<BR>
A something in the air, intangible,<BR>
Yet stiff with meaning, struck my senses sick!&mdash;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Sharp, unfamiliar odors have destroyed<BR>
Each other room's dear personality.<BR>
The heavy scent of damp, funereal flowers,&mdash;<BR>
The very essence, hush-distilled, of Death&mdash;<BR>
Has strangled that habitual breath of home<BR>
Whose expiration leaves all houses dead;<BR>
And wheresoe'er I look is hideous change.<BR>
Save here.  Here 'twas as if a weed-choked gate<BR>
Had opened at my touch, and I had stepped<BR>
Into some long-forgot, enchanted, strange,<BR>
Sweet garden of a thousand years ago<BR>
And suddenly thought, "I have been here before!"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
You are not here.  I know that you are gone,<BR>
And will not ever enter here again.<BR>
And yet it seems to me, if I should speak,<BR>
Your silent step must wake across the hall;<BR>
If I should turn my head, that your sweet eyes<BR>
Would kiss me from the door.&mdash;So short a time<BR>
To teach my life its transposition to<BR>
This difficult and unaccustomed key!&mdash;<BR>
The room is as you left it; your last touch&mdash;<BR>
A thoughtless pressure, knowing not itself<BR>
As saintly&mdash;hallows now each simple thing;<BR>
Hallows and glorifies, and glows between<BR>
The dust's grey fingers like a shielded light.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There is your book, just as you laid it down,<BR>
Face to the table,&mdash;I cannot believe<BR>
That you are gone!&mdash;Just then it seemed to me<BR>
You must be here.  I almost laughed to think<BR>
How like reality the dream had been;<BR>
Yet knew before I laughed, and so was still.<BR>
That book, outspread, just as you laid it down!<BR>
Perhaps you thought, "I wonder what comes next,<BR>
And whether this or this will be the end";<BR>
So rose, and left it, thinking to return.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Perhaps that chair, when you arose and passed<BR>
Out of the room, rocked silently a while<BR>
Ere it again was still. When you were gone<BR>
Forever from the room, perhaps that chair,<BR>
Stirred by your movement, rocked a little while,<BR>
Silently, to and fro...<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And here are the last words your fingers wrote,<BR>
Scrawled in broad characters across a page<BR>
In this brown book I gave you. Here your hand,<BR>
Guiding your rapid pen, moved up and down.<BR>
Here with a looping knot you crossed a "t",<BR>
And here another like it, just beyond<BR>
These two eccentric "e's".  You were so small,<BR>
And wrote so brave a hand!<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 12.5em">How strange it seems</SPAN><BR>
That of all words these are the words you chose!<BR>
And yet a simple choice; you did not know<BR>
You would not write again.  If you had known&mdash;<BR>
But then, it does not matter,&mdash;and indeed<BR>
If you had known there was so little time<BR>
You would have dropped your pen and come to me<BR>
And this page would be empty, and some phrase<BR>
Other than this would hold my wonder now.<BR>
Yet, since you could not know, and it befell<BR>
That these are the last words your fingers wrote,<BR>
There is a dignity some might not see<BR>
In this, "I picked the first sweet-pea to-day."<BR>
To-day!  Was there an opening bud beside it<BR>
You left until to-morrow?&mdash;O my love,<BR>
The things that withered,&mdash;and you came not back!<BR>
That day you filled this circle of my arms<BR>
That now is empty.  (O my empty life!)<BR>
That day&mdash;that day you picked the first sweet-pea,&mdash;<BR>
And brought it in to show me!  I recall<BR>
With terrible distinctness how the smell<BR>
Of your cool gardens drifted in with you.<BR>
I know, you held it up for me to see<BR>
And flushed because I looked not at the flower,<BR>
But at your face; and when behind my look<BR>
You saw such unmistakable intent<BR>
You laughed and brushed your flower against my lips.<BR>
(You were the fairest thing God ever made,<BR>
I think.)  And then your hands above my heart<BR>
Drew down its stem into a fastening,<BR>
And while your head was bent I kissed your hair.<BR>
I wonder if you knew.  (Beloved hands!<BR>
Somehow I cannot seem to see them still.<BR>
Somehow I cannot seem to see the dust<BR>
In your bright hair.)  What is the need of Heaven<BR>
When earth can be so sweet?&mdash;If only God<BR>
Had let us love,&mdash;and show the world the way!<BR>
Strange cancellings must ink th' eternal books<BR>
When love-crossed-out will bring the answer right!<BR>
That first sweet-pea!  I wonder where it is.<BR>
It seems to me I laid it down somewhere,<BR>
And yet,&mdash;I am not sure. I am not sure,<BR>
Even, if it was white or pink; for then<BR>
'Twas much like any other flower to me,<BR>
Save that it was the first.  I did not know,<BR>
Then, that it was the last.  If I had known&mdash;<BR>
But then, it does not matter.  Strange how few,<BR>
After all's said and done, the things that are<BR>
Of moment.<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 2.5em">Few indeed!  When I can make</SPAN><BR>
Of ten small words a rope to hang the world!<BR>
"I had you and I have you now no more."<BR>
There, there it dangles,&mdash;where's the little truth<BR>
That can for long keep footing under that<BR>
When its slack syllables tighten to a thought?<BR>
Here, let me write it down!  I wish to see<BR>
Just how a thing like that will look on paper!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"*I had you and I have you now no more*."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
O little words, how can you run so straight<BR>
Across the page, beneath the weight you bear?<BR>
How can you fall apart, whom such a theme<BR>
Has bound together, and hereafter aid<BR>
In trivial expression, that have been<BR>
So hideously dignified?&mdash;Would God<BR>
That tearing you apart would tear the thread<BR>
I strung you on!  Would God&mdash;O God, my mind<BR>
Stretches asunder on this merciless rack<BR>
Of imagery!  O, let me sleep a while!<BR>
Would I could sleep, and wake to find me back<BR>
In that sweet summer afternoon with you.<BR>
Summer?  'Tis summer still by the calendar!<BR>
How easily could God, if He so willed,<BR>
Set back the world a little turn or two!<BR>
Correct its griefs, and bring its joys again!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
We were so wholly one I had not thought<BR>
That we could die apart.  I had not thought<BR>
That I could move,&mdash;and you be stiff and still!<BR>
That I could speak,&mdash;and you perforce be dumb!<BR>
I think our heart-strings were, like warp and woof<BR>
In some firm fabric, woven in and out;<BR>
Your golden filaments in fair design<BR>
Across my duller fibre.  And to-day<BR>
The shining strip is rent; the exquisite<BR>
Fine pattern is destroyed; part of your heart<BR>
Aches in my breast; part of my heart lies chilled<BR>
In the damp earth with you.  I have been torn<BR>
In two, and suffer for the rest of me.<BR>
What is my life to me?  And what am I<BR>
To life,&mdash;a ship whose star has guttered out?<BR>
A Fear that in the deep night starts awake<BR>
Perpetually, to find its senses strained<BR>
Against the taut strings of the quivering air,<BR>
Awaiting the return of some dread chord?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Dark, Dark, is all I find for metaphor;<BR>
All else were contrast,&mdash;save that contrast's wall<BR>
Is down, and all opposed things flow together<BR>
Into a vast monotony, where night<BR>
And day, and frost and thaw, and death and life,<BR>
Are synonyms.  What now&mdash;what now to me<BR>
Are all the jabbering birds and foolish flowers<BR>
That clutter up the world?  You were my song!<BR>
Now, let discord scream!  You were my flower!<BR>
Now let the world grow weeds!  For I shall not<BR>
Plant things above your grave&mdash;(the common balm<BR>
Of the conventional woe for its own wound!)<BR>
Amid sensations rendered negative<BR>
By your elimination stands to-day,<BR>
Certain, unmixed, the element of grief;<BR>
I sorrow; and I shall not mock my truth<BR>
With travesties of suffering, nor seek<BR>
To effigy its incorporeal bulk<BR>
In little wry-faced images of woe.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I cannot call you back; and I desire<BR>
No utterance of my immaterial voice.<BR>
I cannot even turn my face this way<BR>
Or that, and say, "My face is turned to you";<BR>
I know not where you are, I do not know<BR>
If Heaven hold you or if earth transmute,<BR>
Body and soul, you into earth again;<BR>
But this I know:&mdash;not for one second's space<BR>
Shall I insult my sight with visionings<BR>

Though it must walk a while, as is its wont,<BR>
With wild lamenting!  Would I too might weep<BR>
Where weeps the world and hangs its piteous wreaths<BR>
For its new dead!  Not Truth, but Faith, it is<BR>
That keeps the world alive.  If all at once<BR>
Faith were to slacken,&mdash;that unconscious faith<BR>
Which must, I know, yet be the corner-stone<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Curse thee, Life, I will live with thee no more!<BR>
Thou hast mocked me, starved me, beat my body sore!<BR>
And all for a pledge that was not pledged by me,<BR>
I have kissed thy crust and eaten sparingly<BR>
That I might eat again, and met thy sneers<BR>
With deprecations, and thy blows with tears,&mdash;<BR>
Aye, from thy glutted lash, glad, crawled away,<BR>
As if spent passion were a holiday!<BR>
And now I go.  Nor threat, nor easy vow<BR>
Of tardy kindness can avail thee now<BR>
With me, whence fear and faith alike are flown;<BR>
Lonely I came, and I depart alone,<BR>
And know not where nor unto whom I go;<BR>
But that thou canst not follow me I know."<BR>

"Ah, but I go not as I came,&mdash;no trace<BR>
Is mine to bear away of that old grace<BR>
I brought!  I have been heated in thy fires,<BR>
Bent by thy hands, fashioned to thy desires,<BR>
Thy mark is on me!  I am not the same<BR>
Nor ever more shall be, as when I came.<BR>
Ashes am I of all that once I seemed.<BR>
In me all's sunk that leapt, and all that dreamed<BR>
Is wakeful for alarm,&mdash;oh, shame to thee,<BR>
For the ill change that thou hast wrought in me,<BR>
Who laugh no more nor lift my throat to sing!<BR>
Ah, Life, I would have been a pleasant thing<BR>
To have about the house when I was grown<BR>
If thou hadst left my little joys alone!<BR>
I asked of thee no favor save this one:<BR>
That thou wouldst leave me playing in the sun!<BR>
And this thou didst deny, calling my name<BR>
Insistently, until I rose and came.<BR>
I saw the sun no more.&mdash;It were not well<BR>
So long on these unpleasant thoughts to dwell,<BR>
Need I arise to-morrow and renew<BR>
Again my hated tasks, but I am through<BR>
With all things save my thoughts and this one night,<BR>
So that in truth I seem already quite<BR>
Free and remote from thee,&mdash;I feel no haste<BR>
And no reluctance to depart; I taste<BR>
Merely, with thoughtful mien, an unknown draught,<BR>
That in a little while I shall have quaffed."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thus I to Life, and ceased, and slightly smiled,<BR>
Looking at nothing; and my thin dreams filed<BR>
Before me one by one till once again<BR>
I set new words unto an old refrain:<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Treasures thou hast that never have been mine!<BR>
Warm lights in many a secret chamber shine<BR>
Of thy gaunt house, and gusts of song have blown<BR>
Like blossoms out to me that sat alone!<BR>
And I have waited well for thee to show<BR>
If any share were mine,&mdash;and now I go!<BR>
Nothing I leave, and if I naught attain<BR>
I shall but come into mine own again!"<BR>
Thus I to Life, and ceased, and spake no more,<BR>
But turning, straightway, sought a certain door<BR>
In the rear wall.  Heavy it was, and low<BR>
And dark,&mdash;a way by which none e'er would go<BR>
That other exit had, and never knock<BR>
Was heard thereat,&mdash;bearing a curious lock<BR>
Some chance had shown me fashioned faultily,<BR>
Whereof Life held content the useless key,<BR>
And great coarse hinges, thick and rough with rust,<BR>
Whose sudden voice across a silence must,<BR>
I knew, be harsh and horrible to hear,&mdash;<BR>
A strange door, ugly like a dwarf.&mdash;So near<BR>
I came I felt upon my feet the chill<BR>
Of acid wind creeping across the sill.<BR>
So stood longtime, till over me at last<BR>
Came weariness, and all things other passed<BR>
To make it room; the still night drifted deep<BR>
Like snow about me, and I longed for sleep.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But, suddenly, marking the morning hour,<BR>
Bayed the deep-throated bell within the tower!<BR>
Startled, I raised my head,&mdash;and with a shout<BR>
Laid hold upon the latch,&mdash;and was without.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Ah, long-forgotten, well-remembered road,<BR>
Leading me back unto my old abode,<BR>
My father's house!  There in the night I came,<BR>
And found them feasting, and all things the same<BR>
As they had been before.  A splendour hung<BR>
Upon the walls, and such sweet songs were sung<BR>
As, echoing out of very long ago,<BR>
Had called me from the house of Life, I know.<BR>
So fair their raiment shone I looked in shame<BR>
On the unlovely garb in which I came;<BR>
Then straightway at my hesitancy mocked:<BR>
"It is my father's house!" I said and knocked;<BR>
And the door opened.  To the shining crowd<BR>
Tattered and dark I entered, like a cloud,<BR>
Seeing no face but his; to him I crept,<BR>
And "Father!" I cried, and clasped his knees, and wept.<BR>
Ah, days of joy that followed!  All alone<BR>
I wandered through the house.  My own, my own,<BR>
My own to touch, my own to taste and smell,<BR>
All I had lacked so long and loved so well!<BR>
None shook me out of sleep, nor hushed my song,<BR>
Nor called me in from the sunlight all day long.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I know not when the wonder came to me<BR>
Of what my father's business might be,<BR>
And whither fared and on what errands bent<BR>
The tall and gracious messengers he sent.<BR>
Yet one day with no song from dawn till night<BR>
Wondering, I sat, and watched them out of sight.<BR>
And the next day I called; and on the third<BR>
Asked them if I might go,&mdash;but no one heard.<BR>
Then, sick with longing, I arose at last<BR>
And went unto my father,&mdash;in that vast<BR>
Chamber wherein he for so many years<BR>
Has sat, surrounded by his charts and spheres.<BR>
"Father," I said, "Father, I cannot play<BR>
The harp that thou didst give me, and all day<BR>
I sit in idleness, while to and fro<BR>
About me thy serene, grave servants go;<BR>
And I am weary of my lonely ease.<BR>
Better a perilous journey overseas<BR>
Away from thee, than this, the life I lead,<BR>
To sit all day in the sunshine like a weed<BR>
That grows to naught,&mdash;I love thee more than they<BR>
Who serve thee most; yet serve thee in no way.<BR>
Father, I beg of thee a little task<BR>
To dignify my days,&mdash;'tis all I ask<BR>
Forever, but forever, this denied,<BR>
I perish."<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 5em">"Child," my father's voice replied,</SPAN><BR>
"All things thy fancy hath desired of me<BR>
Thou hast received.  I have prepared for thee<BR>
Within my house a spacious chamber, where<BR>
Are delicate things to handle and to wear,<BR>
And all these things are thine.  Dost thou love song?<BR>
My minstrels shall attend thee all day long.<BR>
Or sigh for flowers?  My fairest gardens stand<BR>
Open as fields to thee on every hand.<BR>
And all thy days this word shall hold the same:<BR>
No pleasure shalt thou lack that thou shalt name.<BR>
But as for tasks&mdash;" he smiled, and shook his head;<BR>
"Thou hadst thy task, and laidst it by", he said.<BR>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
